# ![Flutter RealWorld Example App](images/flutter_realworld.png)

> ### [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.d92.conduite)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) community styleguides & best practices.
